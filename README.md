# Dudes
Hello, I am BOYLOOKMEINMYFACE

This is my Dudes code

This code generates dudes that runs around the canvas.
When dudes hit the wall, they will bounce off.
they will also bounce off of each other.
Except for the ones in love with another Dude.
Dudes have love hate relationships and they can be assigned a loved one.
If they are haters, they will only roam around randomly.
If they are lovers, they will chase the dude they love.
There are very strong competitions between the lovers,
So a dude can only be loved by one other dude.
Sometimes when dudes are forced into a corner, the lovers get them.
